I"=	<p>As a child matures into adulthood it’s often difficult for some parents to come to terms with the reality that their child is now a mature adult capable of taking decisions regarding his or her finance, career, lifestyle and relationships. Parents who find flaws in these decisions tend to protect the child by trying to give advice and support which are not always welcome by the adult child who now seeks complete independence and feels that he or she is in control of his or her life. This sometimes leads to unhealthy conflicts between the two generations. An adult child should decide what level of privacy and involvement he or she seeks from the parent. It becomes the responsibility of both the adult child and the parents to shape and manage the relationship. An adult child has to understand that the parents are still concerned of his/her safety and well-being and in their psyche the child still needs guidance and advice which appear unsolicited.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The adult child has now the responsibility to make the parents understand that he or she can now think maturely and make decisions. Parents now need to give space to the adult child and stop interfering in the adult child’s life and respect the decision the child makes. Both need compromise and negotiation and find mutually enjoyable ways to connect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The adult child needs to understand that the parents are more experienced and can turn to them when there is a setback or when he or she cannot make a proper life decision. Parents will always be by their side and most of them will give their best to support their child through thick and thin whenever needed.</p>

<p>Mutual understanding will lead to a healthy and enjoyable relationship free of conflict and passive aggression. Many adults maintain an active relationship with their parents and relate to each other as equals. As parents grow older and weaker, an adult may take the responsibility of aging parents sometimes much in the same way the parents took care of him or her. This brings both stress and joy in the life of the adult child as the mutual relationship is redefined.</p>
