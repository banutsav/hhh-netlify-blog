It is during toddlerhood a child starts asserting the desire for autonomy and this period called the “terrible twos” can stress the parents. What parents should realize is that this behaviour is actually normal for the toddler and this desire for independence should be facilitated by parents by encouraging the child, monitoring and guiding at the same time.

> A baby at this stage will like to eat and bathe on his/her own, become inquisitive, ask too many questions and try to explore every corner of the house discovering new things. Development of the toddler’s motor skills makes the child physically active and energetic. This is the period of fearlessness and the child can hurt himself/herself in the process. While its necessary to let the baby assert autonomy, he/she needs constant attention to prevent any accidental hurting.

As the child develops speech at this stage, he/she will talk constantly. The more one communicates, the quicker the child learns. This is the time for parents to teach their child the dos and don’ts. Around the age of three a child is ready to interact socially and make friends with children of the same age group. As the child at the end of the first year learns to walk and run, starts exploring, some of them show certain behavioral traits. While some are obedient and docile, some tend to show their anger when their interests and demands are thwarted and start throwing tantrums. 

**Strict discipline from parents at this age will act negatively on the child’s behaviour and he/she will become increasingly stubborn and will refuse to act according to the wishes of the parents.**

With affectionate guidance and teaching such demands can be restricted. Keeping a toddler busy is
extremely necessary   to help channelize his/her energy. Proper activities will   keep the child
engaged and happy. Busy parents can keep the toddler in a play pen with different activity based
educational toys. These toys help children to develop problem solving skills, develop their motor skills and also nurture the creativity and imagination of the child. When playing with siblings or other kids the child learns sharing. Proper toys also develop the child’s social and emotional intelligence and improve concentration.
